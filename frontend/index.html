				<h1>Global Istio Gateway</h1>
				<p>Global Istio Gateway is a project aimed to deploy istio as an anycast ingress gateway for apps globally. The idea is loosely inspired by services like Cloudflare, and Fastly. </p>
				
				<p> The Idea, in simple terms, is that we would have multiple instances of kubernetes running in various cloud and data centers, hosting istio gateways. Users would register their services on a dashboard. These would be registered as dns services. In return they would be given a publically accessable domain(like MyProject.global.backendengineer.net).  </p>

				<!-- <p>All traffic for this service(including tls) will be proxied through the global backendengineer network. At the heart of all of this operations is istio. It would be the application server and this project is a large deployment of it across various cloud providers.  </p> -->

				<!-- <p>In the grand scheme of things, this is an educational project that is being built to understand certain intricate nature of networks and global proxying.  </p> -->
